# Print Mutiplication Table 
nums = int(input("Enter a number to print its multiplication table: "))
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(f"{nums} x {i} = {nums * i}")
# For example print multiplication table of 2 enter 2 and run the code same as for 3,4,5,etc.
# Output:
# Enter a number to print its multiplication table: 2
# 2 x 1 = 2
# 2 x 2 = 4
# 2 x 3 = 6
# 2 x 4 = 8
# 2 x 5 = 10
# 2 x 6 = 12
# 2 x 7 = 14
# 2 x 8 = 16
# 2 x 9 = 18
# 2 x 10 = 20
